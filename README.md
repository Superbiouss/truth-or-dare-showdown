*A fun, competitive, and AI-powered party game for friends and family.*

Truth or Dare Showdown is a web-based party game built with Next.js and Genkit. Players enter their names, choose a game category, and take turns tackling truths or dares generated by a creative AI that stays up-to-date with trending topics and pop culture. The game features scoring, a persistent game history, and the ability to resume an unfinished game if you get interrupted.

## âœ¨ Features

-   **Trendy AI-Powered Prompts**: Unique and engaging truth, dare, and "wildcard" challenges generated by Google's Gemini model. The AI is specifically instructed to use trending social media challenges, pop culture, and memes to keep the game fresh and relatable.
-   **Player Setup**: Add up to 8 players with custom names, genders, and fun avatars.
-   **Game Customization**: Choose between Kids, Teens, and 18+ categories for age-appropriate fun. Adjust the number of rounds and, for 18+, the intensity levelâ€”all the way up to an "extreme" mode with fewer safety filters.
-   **Resume Unfinished Games**: Never lose your progress! If the browser is refreshed, the current game state is automatically saved and reloaded, so you can pick up right where you left off.
-   **Scoring & Leaderboards**: Earn points for completing prompts and see who comes out on top at the end of the game.
-   **Game History**: Automatically saves past games to your browser's local storage so you can relive your most memorable showdowns.
-   **Theme Personalization**: Personalize the app's look with multiple accent colors and light/dark modes.
-   **AI Announcer**: An optional text-to-speech feature reads prompts aloud using the browser's reliable native Web Speech API.
